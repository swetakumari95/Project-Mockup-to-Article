-I learnt HTML, the markup language used to describe the structure of web pages.
-This project was easy as I had to just look carefully at the pdf, and make changes in index.html using Mozilla Developer Network as a guide.
-There was nothing difficult in this project.
-I used the technique of coding, comparing and refining the code until it looked exactly like the markup provided.
